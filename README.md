## 🚀 Best Way to Explore: Debate with AI
Don't just read — argue.

1. Download any PDF  
2. Upload to Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini  
3. Try these prompts:

- "Summarize Node Capitalism. How does Proof of Energy differ from Proof of Work?"
- "Compare this to Elon Musk's companies. Is TeslaNode already real?"
- "Find flaws in PoET. Is thermodynamic verification unbreakable?"
- "If this happens by 2030, how does daily life change?"

The real understanding begins when you challenge the AI.
